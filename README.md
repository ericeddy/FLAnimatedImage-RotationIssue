# FLAnimatedImage-RotationIssue

So when the app loads, the Gifs will load into the cells, and animate fine, but when you start scrolling down, the cells will load the Jpgs, which also load fine, but when you scroll back up to the gifs, they are rotated,

It seems like not all Jpgs will cause this to happens, random ones sourced from google don't always cause it. Most reliably, the images that are taken with the phones camera are the ones causing the issue to occur.
